Server -> My IP [SYN, ACK]
My IP -> Server [ACK]
My IP -> Server GET/HTTP

Curl is a tool for transferring data from or to a server using URLs.
While using curl example.com, the results are similar to opening example.com on the browser on Wireshark. The terminal displays the raw html.

When visiting http://github.com, the url changes to https as it's using a secure http protocol. We can only read the first couple of messages, everything else is secure "Application Data".
