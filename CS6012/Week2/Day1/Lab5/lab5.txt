What activities did you do as the driver? What activities did you do as the navigator?
-I drove the first method, and my partner, Ajith, wrote the second
What are the advantages and disadvantages of serving in each role?
-As a driver, I could figure out the general logic and pseudocode, but it was hard to envision the syntax without writing
How often did you and your partner switch roles? Did you switch often enough?
-we switched after on method was written, we each wrote one method
Which is your preferred role and why?
I prefer to drive, as it removes me from syntax worries and I can focus on the logic
Explain why this is a BAD test case for your method: assertEquals("bird", MedianSolver.median(new String[]{"bird", "cat", "dog", "ant"}))
-the method returns "bird" which is the first of 2 middle elements so it can be confusing to return it as the "median"
Explain how you could change the test to make it "valid" and explain how you could change the specification so that this is considered a "good" test
-we can add another string to the array such that "bird" remains the median and return it.
